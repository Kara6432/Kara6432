# Hi, I am Kara!

### üëã Hello World

Hey there, I'm Kara! I'm supposed to write something informative and interesting about myself, but honestly the task of writing something never really appealed to me... ü•¥

Currently working on a lot of projects, of which most (all) of them are sadly closed source. At least for now...

Most of my time flows into my Minecraft Server Project called [HailightMC](https://www.github.com/HailightMC). Currently I am rewriting its entire core, so yeah... expect it to take a lot of time to even get a working beta test server.

As for the rest of my time, I like to use it to code all sorts of useful and practical things... ü§ì

### ‚≠ê Skills

* My all-time favorite (really, nothing can beat it) programming language (and the one I use most): [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)) üòç
* Minecraft got me into learning Java specifically using these frameworks: [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org) & [Fabric](https://www.fabricmc.net). ü§©
* The only other language I know (and despise üôÉ): [Python](https://www.python.org) üòë
* The thing that got me into programming: [BPY](https://docs.blender.org/api/current/index.html) - The Blender python addon API.
* [Blender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blender_(software)) (didn't touch it in a while but I would still consider it as one of my skills)

### üíé Stats

Watch out! My GitHub streak - an unbroken chain of code commits stretching back into the mists of time... or at least as far back as the streak stats widget will let me go. ü§Ø

### ü§™ About Me (Part II):

* My favorite color is [#CF9FFF](https://github.com/Kara6432/Kara6432/blob/main/CF9FFF.png) (or at least something purpleish...). üé®
* I'm a huge fan of Minecraft - if that wasn't already obvious... But more on the technical side of it...
* Java is the superior programming language ü§ó (I feel like I am repeating myself, cuz there still seem to be people who hate it...?) I also don't like Kotlin... Java is superior!
* Lastly, I believe that **Mathematics is Art** - just look at this gorgeous equality: $$e^{i\theta}=\cos\left(\theta\right)+i\sin\left(\theta\right)$$ Beautiful, isn't it? üòç
* In combination with the point above: I study mathematics although still attending school (10. Grade in Germany) üë©‚Äçüéì ... [more info](https://fruehstudium.fau.de)
