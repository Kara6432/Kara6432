# Kara

Hi. I am Kara. I don't know what to write about me, so... 🥺\
Most of the time I work on my project called [KaraPowered](https://www.github.com/KaraPowered) (I know very original). It is a Minecraft Server built completely from scratch. No Mojang code or anything else. Just plain old Java with a few (<100 🙃) dependencies.\
When I get stuck, I like to work on my Bedwars plugin that runs on [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org). There is nothing much to say about it, it is just a simple Bedwars plugin.
The rest of my time I like to spend coding other especially usefull things. 🫠

### 🛠️ Languages and Tools:
