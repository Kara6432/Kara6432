## Kara

Hey there, I'm Kara! I'm supposed to write something witty and interesting about myself, but honestly I'm drawing a blank... 🥴

Most of my time is spent working on my project, [KaraPowered](https://www.github.com/KaraPowered) (incredibly original name) - it's a Minecraft server built completely from scratch, without any of that Mojang code or other nonsense. Just plain old (19+) Java, with a few (<100 🙃) dependencies. When I'm not elbow-deep in code, I like to tinker with my Bedwars plugin for [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org), but honestly, there's not much to say about it - it's just a simple (>200 files) plugin for a simple game.

As for the rest of my time, I like to use it to code all sorts of useful and practical things... or at least that's what I tell myself. 🤓

### 🛠️ Languages and Tools:

* My all-time favorite programming language (and the one I use most): **[Java](https://www.java.com)** 😍
* I learned Java specifically for **[Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org)** and **[Fabric](https://www.fabricmc.net)**. 🤩
* The only other language I know (and despise): **[Python](https://www.python.org)** 😑
* It all started with **[BPY](https://docs.blender.org/api/current/index.html)** - the gateway drug to programming. 🤗

### 💎 Stats

Behold! My GitHub streak - an unbroken chain of code commits stretching back into the mists of time... or at least as far back as the [streak stats widget](https://streak-stats.demolab.com) will let me go. 🤯

### 🤪 About Me (Part Deux):

* My favorite color is [#CF9FFF](CF9FFF.png). I have no idea why, it just speaks to me. 🎨
* I'm a huge Minecraft fan - if that wasn't already obvious. 🎮
* I code practically every day - I like to think it keeps me out of trouble. 😎
* Java is the superior programming language. Fight me. 💪
* Lastly, I believe that mathematics is art - just look at this gorgeous equation: $$e^{iy}=\cos\left(y\right)+i\sin\left(y\right)$$ Beautiful, isn't it? 😍
