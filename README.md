# Kara

Hey there, I'm Kara! I'm supposed to write something witty and interesting about myself, but honestly I don't know what to write... 🥴

Most of my time is spent working on my project, [KaraPowered](https://www.github.com/KaraPowered) (incredibly original name, especially when you see the names of these other Minecraft server alternatives: [SpongePowered](https://www.spongepowered.org/), [VelocityPowered](https://www.velocitypowered.com/)) - it's a Minecraft server built completely from scratch, without any of that Mojang code or other nonsense. Just plain old (18+, yeah I don't use LTS versions. I wanna have all the new features 🤓) Java, with a few (<100 🙃, not to many...) dependencies. 

When I'm not elbow-deep in code, I like to tinker with my [Bedwars plugin](https://www.github.com/Kara6432/Bedwars) (which turned into a whole Minecraft server network, called Kara Network... See, very creative naming...).

As for the rest of my time, I like to use it to code all sorts of useful and practical things... or at least that's what I tell myself. 🤓

### 🛠️ Languages and Tools:

* My all-time favorite (really, nothing can beat it) programming language (and the one I use most): **[Java](https://www.java.com)** 😍
* I learned Java specifically for **[Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org)** and **[Fabric](https://www.fabricmc.net)**. 🤩
* The only other language I know (and despise 🙃): **[Python](https://www.python.org)** 😑
* It all started with **[BPY](https://docs.blender.org/api/current/index.html)** - the gateway to programming. 🤗

### 💎 Stats

Behold! My GitHub streak - an unbroken chain of code commits stretching back into the mists of time... or at least as far back as the [streak stats widget](https://streak-stats.demolab.com) will let me go. 🤯

(or maybe not...)

### 🤪 About Me (II):

* My favorite color is [#CF9FFF](https://github.com/Kara6432/Kara6432/blob/main/CF9FFF.png) (or at least something purpleish...). I have no idea why... I just like it 🎨
* I'm a huge Minecraft fan - if that wasn't already obvious.
* I code practically every day (totally unexpected) 😎
* Java is the superior programming language. 🤗 (I feel like I am repeating myself, cuz there still seem to be people who hate it...?)
* Lastly, I believe that mathematics is art - just look at this gorgeous equation: $$e^{i\theta}=\cos\left(\theta\right)+i\sin\left(\theta\right)$$ Beautiful, isn't it? 😍
* Btw, in combination with the point above: I study mathematics although I still go to school (10. Grade in Germany)👩‍🎓
